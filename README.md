Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
### Waterfall Methodology
**Advantages:**
* **Structured Approach:** Provides a clear, linear sequence of phases, making it easier to plan and manage.
* **Well-suited for Predictable Projects:** Ideal for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal uncertainty.
* **Comprehensive Documentation:** Produces detailed documentation throughout the project lifecycle.
**Disadvantages:**
* **Rigid and Less Flexible:** Once a phase is complete, it's difficult to make significant changes.
* **Limited Customer Involvement:** Customer feedback is often limited to the initial requirements gathering phase.
* **Risk of Delayed Feedback:** Issues may not be identified until late in the development cycle.

### Agile Methodology
**Advantages:**
* **Flexibility:** Adapts to changing requirements and priorities.
* **Continuous Delivery:** Delivers working software frequently.
* **Customer Collaboration:** Encourages active customer involvement.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Identifies and addresses risks early in the development cycle.
**Disadvantages:**
* **Less Structured:** Requires a high degree of self-organization and discipline from the team.
* **Potential for Scope Creep:** Without careful planning, the project scope can expand.
* **Less Suitable for Large-Scale Projects:** Can be challenging to scale for complex, large-scale projects.

In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile methodologies are best suited for projects with:
* **Uncertain or Evolving Requirements:** When the exact requirements aren't fully defined upfront, Agile's iterative approach allows for flexibility and adaptability.
* **Frequent Changes:** If the project is likely to experience frequent changes in scope or priorities, Agile's iterative nature helps manage these changes effectively.
* **Customer Collaboration:** When involving the customer in the development process is crucial, Agile's emphasis on collaboration ensures their needs are met.
* **Rapid Delivery:** For projects that require quick time-to-market, Agile's iterative development approach enables faster delivery of working software.
* **Innovative Projects:** When exploring new technologies or approaches, Agile's flexibility allows for experimentation and learning.
**Example:** Developing a mobile app with a rapidly changing market and evolving user needs.
  
Waterfall methodologies are better suited for projects with:
* **Well-Defined Requirements:** When the requirements are clear, stable, and unlikely to change significantly.
* **Strict Deadlines and Budgets:** Waterfall's structured approach can help maintain control over project timelines and costs.
* **Regulatory Compliance:** For projects that must adhere to strict regulatory standards, Waterfall's emphasis on documentation and control can be beneficial.
* **Large-Scale Projects:** While Agile can be scaled, Waterfall can be more suitable for large, complex projects with well-defined phases and deliverables.
**Example:** Building a large-scale enterprise software system with strict regulatory compliance requirements.
